## New API Endpoints

### Dashboard Statistics
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Revenue, cases, clients statistics
- `GET /api/dashboard/activity` - Recent activity feed
- `GET /api/dashboard/notifications` - Important notifications

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### 1. Environment Setup

Create `.env` file in the server directory:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lawyer_zen
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080

# Email Configuration (optional)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 2. Database Setup

Start MongoDB service and ensure it's running on the configured port.

### 3. Server Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

The server will start on port 5000 (or your configured PORT).

### 4. Client Setup

```bash
cd ..  # Back to root directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

The client will start on port 8080.

### 5. Production Deployment

#### Server (Backend)
```bash
cd server
npm install --production
npm run build  # If you have a build script
pm2 start index.js --name lawyer-zen-api
```

#### Client (Frontend)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to your web server
```

## Database Collections

The application uses the following MongoDB collections:

### Core Collections
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `cases` - Legal cases and hearings
- `clients` - Client information
- `invoices` - Billing and payments
- `timeentries` - Time tracking for billable hours
- `alerts` - Custom notifications and reminders

### New Collections
- `activities` - User activity logging (auto-expires after 90 days)

## Features Overview

### Dashboard Statistics
- **Total Cases**: Count of all cases with active case breakdown
- **Clients**: Total registered clients
- **Today's Hearings**: Cases scheduled for today with urgency indicators
- **Revenue This Month**: Real revenue calculation from invoices and billable time

### Activity Feed
- **Case Management**: Creation, updates, and status changes
- **Client Management**: New registrations and updates
- **Financial Activities**: Invoice creation, payments received
- **Time Tracking**: Billable and non-billable time logging

### Smart Notifications
- **Today's Hearings**: All cases scheduled for today
- **Tomorrow's Hearings**: Upcoming cases for tomorrow
- **Urgent Cases**: High-priority cases requiring attention
- **Overdue Invoices**: Unpaid invoices past due date
- **Custom Alerts**: User-created reminders and notifications

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- User-based queries are indexed for fast retrieval
- Activity collection has TTL index for automatic cleanup
- Date-based queries are optimized with compound indexes

### API Optimizations
- Efficient aggregation pipelines for revenue calculations
- Limited result sets to prevent large data transfers
- Proper error handling to prevent crashes

### Frontend Optimizations
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Loading states for better user experience
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` - API health status

### Database Maintenance
- Activities auto-expire after 90 days
- Regular MongoDB maintenance recommended

### Logging
- Server logs all errors and important events
- Activity logging for user action tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Revenue showing ₹0**
   - Ensure invoices have `status: 'paid'` and `paidAt` date
   - Check time entries have `billable: true`

2. **No recent activity**
   - Activity logging starts after deployment
   - Falls back to generating from existing data

3. **Notifications not updating**
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify case `hearingDate` fields are properly set

4. **API errors**
   - Check MongoDB connection string
   - Verify JWT_SECRET is set
   - Ensure all required environment variables are configured

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens for authentication
- User-based data isolation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CORS configuration for production
- Environment variables for sensitive data

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for client-side errors
2. Check server logs for backend issues
3. Verify MongoDB connection and data integrity
4. Ensure all environment variables are properly set

The application is now fully functional with real data integration and ready for production deployment.
